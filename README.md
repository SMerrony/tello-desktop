# tello-desktop
Functioning desktop testbed for flying the DJI Tello drone via Gobot.

_Play with this entirely at your own risk - it's not the author's fault if you lose your drone
or damage it or something else when using this software._

An unpolished, but working, utility to try out new features on the dji/tello platform in the Gobot library.

Currently provides 
* live video via mplayer
* joystick control via a Thustmaster T-Flight flight controller
* stream of drone info to the console

Only tested on GNU/Linux so far.
